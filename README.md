# 🐹 Learning Go

This repository documents my **Golang learning journey**, with code, exercises, and notes from the lessons I do daily.  

🔄 The repository is **updated every day** with new lessons and exercises.

## 📌 Current Status

Currently, I am studying:  
- [`fundamentals/`](1-fundamentals) → Syntax, types, loops, functions, structs, etc.

The repository will continue to grow and eventually include:  
- `concurrency/` → Goroutines, channels, WaitGroup, concurrency patterns, and **exercises for each topic**  
- `stdlib/` → Exercises on main standard library packages (`fmt`, `strings`, `strconv`, `time`, etc.)  
- `testing/` → **Unit tests applied to all exercises in the previous directories**

**📁 Each main directory will have its own README**, explaining its contents and how to navigate through the exercises and code.
