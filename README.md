# 🐹 Learning Go

This repository documents my **Golang learning journey**, with code, exercises, and notes from the lessons I do daily.  

🔄 The repository is **updated every day** with new lessons and exercises.

## 📌 Current Status

Currently, I am studying:  
- [`fundamentals/`](1-fundamentals) → Syntax, types, loops, functions, structs, etc.

The repository will continue to grow and eventually include:  
- `concurrency/` → Goroutines, channels, WaitGroup, concurrency patterns, and **exercises for each topic**  
- `stdlib/` → Exercises on main standard library packages (`fmt`, `strings`, `strconv`, `time`, etc.)  
- `testing/` → **Unit tests applied to all exercises in the previous directories**

**📁 Each main directory will have its own README**, explaining its contents and how to navigate through the exercises and code.

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-go.git

2. Navigate to the directory you want to explore. Each directory contains its own code and instructions on how to run it.

3. For Go files in a directory, typically you can run:
    ```
    go run main.go

4. To run tests (when available):
    ```
    go test ./...

💡 **Tip:** if you are using an editor like VS Code with *Code Runner*, you can run the active file directly using `Ctrl + Alt + N`, without navigating to the directory.
