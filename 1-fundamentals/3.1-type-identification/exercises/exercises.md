1-Create a function that receives a generic value and displays its actual type in a formatted output.

2-Develop a function that receives a generic value and checks if it is an integer, displaying a corresponding message.

3-Create a function that receives different types of values ​​and displays the type of each one on separate lines.

4-Implement a function that receives a text and displays a message indicating that the value is a string.

5-Create a code snippet that calls a type checking function with values ​​of different types and displays the results.

6-Develop a function that uses a generic type and displays the underlying type of the received value.

7-Create a function that uses the reflection package to determine the type of a variable and display the result.

8-Create a function that identifies whether a generic value is an integer, text, or other type, displaying a message for each case.

9-Implement a generic function that receives any value and uses reflection to identify whether the argument is a number (integer or decimal). If it is, display the detected numeric type; otherwise, indicate that the value is not numeric.

10-Create a function that receives values ​​in sequence and displays the type of each one using a dynamic type detection technique.

11-Develop a function that identifies the type of a variable and returns a string describing it.

12-Create a function that receives a list containing values ​​of different types and displays the index and type of each item.

13-Implement a function that receives a value and displays its type, recognizing only int, string, and bool. For other types, display "Unsupported type".

14-Create a function that compares two generic values ​​and displays messages indicating whether or not they are of the same type.

15-Create a function that uses reflection to identify the type of a value and return both the name and the category of the type.

16-Implement a function that receives a heterogeneous list and uses a multi-case conditional structure to handle each data type differently.

17-Develop a function that receives a generic value and performs different actions depending on whether it is an integer, decimal, or text.

18-Create a function that uses reflection to distinguish between signed and unsigned numeric types and display specific messages.

19-Implement a function that combines explicit type checking and reflection to double-check the type of a value.

20-Create a function that accepts any type of value, identifies the type at runtime, and returns a customized message based on that type.
