1-Create two numeric variables with the same type and assign the value of one to the other in such a way that they represent an independent copy.

2-Display the values ​​of the two variables and verify that they are identical after copying.

3-Modify the value of the original variable and display both again to see if the second one was affected.

4-Create a numeric variable and another variable intended to store a memory address compatible with it.

5-Associate the address of the numeric variable with the variable that stores the address and display the value of both.

6-Display in the output the contents of the address variable and also the value it points to.

7-Change the original value of the numeric variable and display the value obtained through the address variable again.

8-Modify the value stored in the numeric variable using indirect memory address access, and confirm that the original value has been changed.

9-Create a function that takes a common numeric value and displays the result of a simple operation without modifying the original value.

10-Create a function that receives a memory address from a variable and directly changes the value contained in it.

11-Create a function that returns a newly allocated memory address containing an initial numeric value.

12-Develop a code that stores multiple memory addresses in a collection and modifies each value pointed to.

13-Create a struct, instantiate it with an initial value, and develop a function that receives a pointer to that instance and changes the value of the field, demonstrating the direct modification of the instance.

14-Implement a function that receives a memory address and redefines it to point to a different memory address.

15-Create an example that clearly demonstrates the difference between changing the content pointed to and changing the address itself stored in a pointer variable.

16-Create a sequence of function calls that use pointer chaining (pointer to pointer) and manipulate the final value ind.

17-Create an integer variable, a pointer to it, and another pointer that stores the address of that pointer. Implement a function that receives this pointer to the pointer and makes the original pointer point to another integer variable.

18-Create an integer variable and a pointer that points to it. Then, create a pointer to that pointer. Implement a function that, using only the pointer to the pointer, changes the value of the original variable.

19-Create two separate string variables. Create a pointer that points to the first variable and a double pointer that points to that pointer. Write a function that replaces the address stored in the single pointer to point to the second variable, using only the double pointer.

20-Create an integer variable, a simple pointer to it, a double pointer that stores the address of that simple pointer, and a triple pointer that stores the address of the double pointer. Implement a function that receives the triple pointer and changes its original integer value.

21-Create two distinct integer variables. Create a simple pointer pointing to one of them. Create a double pointer storing the address of this simple pointer. Create a triple pointer storing the address of the double pointer. Implement a function that receives the triple pointer and makes the simple pointer point to the other variable.
