1-Create a structure composed of two simple fields: a text field and a small integer field.

2-At the program's entry point, declare a variable with an explicit type of a created structure and assign individual values ​​to each field.

3-Create a structure with two fields. At the program's entry point, declare a variable of this structure, assign values ​​to both fields, and display the complete variable in the standard output.

4-Create a structure called location with two fields related to location information (for example, city and country). At the program's entry point (main), declare a variable of this structure, assign values ​​to both fields, and display the complete variable in the standard output.

5-Create a structure called Location with two fields related to location information. Create a structure called Person and add Location as a field within it, representing a composition between types.

6-Create a structure called Location and another called Person that contains Location as a field. Assign values ​​to the internal Location field within Person and display the complete result.

7-Create an instance of a composite structure using direct initialization, filling all fields in sequence.

8-Create a structure called Person. Create a new instance of this structure using named initialization to fill only a few specific fields.

9-Create a structure called Person and three instances of it, each initialized in a different way. Display each instance in the standard output, noting the differences between the initialization formats.

10-Create a structure called Address and another called Person that contains Address as a field. Create an Address variable and use it as the value of the corresponding field in Person.

11-Create a structure called Location and another called Person that contains Location as a field. Instantiate Person, filling in all the fields, and display the instance in the standard output. Then, change an internal field of Location and display the instance again to show the change.

12-Create a function that receives a structure as an argument and displays one of its fields to standard output.

13-Create a function that receives a composite structure as a parameter and returns a new structure with all fields modified.

14-Develop a function that creates and directly returns an instance of a structure, populating its fields internally.

15-Create a composite type called Person that contains fields of different types, including a field based on another user-defined type. At the program's entry point, initialize a complete instance of this composite type.

16-Create two related structures, one composed of the other. Create an instance using partial field assignment and then replace some internal values ​​to demonstrate data updating.

17-Create a function that receives multiple structures, combines their fields into a new instance, and returns the result.

18-Create three nested structures: a main structure containing an inner structure, which in turn contains another inner structure. Instantiate all structures, assign values ​​to each field at all levels, and display the final result.
